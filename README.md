# MST
This project contains the method to find Minimum spanning tree of a given graph. You are provided the option of either choosing the Prim's Algorithm or the Kruskal's algorithm. Initially the colour of the edges are solid black, but when you compute the Minimum Spanning tree for the graph, the colour of the edges changes to Red.
